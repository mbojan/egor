I went through the scripts from my recent analyses (GSS 2004) and collected concrete problems/questions I needed to compute/answer. I decided to make a separate document (an `Rmd` in `tests/testthat`) based on the subset data I comitted to the package (`gss2004`). Probably some of the items below are contained in the items in the wiki. But just probably. The list is by no means exhaustive.

# Data

See `?gss2004`. Data are labelled. I drop the labels as this is a huge but separate issue which causes a lot of warnings (mostly harmless though).

```{r load-gss}
data(gss2004)

gss2004 <- gss2004 %>%
  labelled::remove_labels()
```




Now we create data frames for egos, for alters, and with alter-alter ties. Processing might be helpful when implementing import functions. The data frames will be used in usecases below too.

Ego data frame:

```{r egodf}
egodf <- gss2004 %>%
  select(id, matches("[^0-9]$"))

egodf %>%
  head() %>%
  kable()
```

Alter data frame:

```{r alterdf}
alterdf <-
gss2004 %>%
  select(
    id_ego = id,
    matches("[a-z][0-9]$")
  ) %>%
  gather(var, val, -id_ego) %>%
  tidyr::extract(
    var, 
    into = c("variable", "id_alter"),
    regex = "([a-z]+)([0-9])"
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    id_alter = as.numeric(id_alter)
  )

# Alter attribute names
vnames <-
  alterdf %>%
  pull(variable) %>%
  unique()

alterdf <-
  alterdf %>%
  spread(variable, val)

alterdf %>%
  head() %>%
  kable()
```

Alter-alter "ties":

```{r aadf}
aadf <-
  gss2004 %>%
  select(
    id_ego = id,
    matches("close[0-9]{2}$")
  ) %>%
  gather(var, val, -id_ego) %>%
  tidyr::extract(
    var,
    into = c("variable", "from", "to"),
    regex = "(close)([0-9])([0-9])"
  ) %>%
  mutate_at(
    c("from", "to", 'val'),
    as.numeric
  ) %>%
  spread(variable, val)

aadf %>%
  head() %>%
  kable()

```


### Descriptive stats on ego variables

Such as frequency tables, crosstabs, etc.


### Descriptive stats on alter variables

As above.

### Descriptive stats on alter-alter variables

In GSS 2004 alter-alter ties are represented with variables `closeXY` (with `X=1:4` and `Y=2:5`) such that, say, `close12` is a variable describing, according to Ego, how close alters 1 and 2 are. The are



### Tabulate alter attribute vs ego attribute

... with counts based on alters, i.e. on `left_join(alters, egos)`
